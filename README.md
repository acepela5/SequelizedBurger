# Overview
Use this app to see what burgers are avalible to be eaten! A list of avalible burgers is dynamically created on the left side using data from a table in MySQL. Each burger has a button that when clicked will move the burger to the right side and mark it as "Devoured".The user can create a burger name and add it to the list. The table in MySQL is also updated to reflect the same data as the app.
